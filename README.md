# SRLS - Sandia RPM Lane Simulator

# Building and Running

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compile and run in Electron (with hot reloads)

```
npm run electron:serve
```

_Note: At the current time, browser-based testing (npm run serve) does not
work because of an internal JavaScript exception._

### Run unit tests

```
npm run test:unit
```

# Creating an installer

To create an installer for SRLS, run the following command.

```
npm run electron:build
```

This will create an installer for the platform that you are running on and put it in ./dist_electron.

| Platform | Build Product        |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Mac      | SRLS_Setup-1.0.1.dmg |
| Windows  | SRLS_Setup-1.0.1.exe |
| Linux    | TBD                  |

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

# Developer Notes

## 1. Console output

If you want to see console output from the main process (e.g. from background.js), you
need to set an environment variable, ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING, to 1.

## 2. Global model data

A simple way to share Vue model data among components is to define and export it in main.ts. Then add references to it in the components that need it.

```
# main.ts
export let AppData = {
    apptitle: "RPM Simulator"
}


# App.vue

<v-toolbar-title class="white--text">{{apptitle}}</v-toolbar-title>

...

import { AppData } from './main';

...

export default {
    name: "App",
    components: {
        HelloWorld
    },
    data() {
        return AppData;
    }
};


```
